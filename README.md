# 👨‍💻 About the Engineer
**Fazal Shaik** | Lead Engineer & Patent Holder  
*Master’s in Data Science & AI/ML*  
**Portfolio:** [fazalportfolio-orcin.vercel.app](https://fazalportfolio-orcin.vercel.app/)

> "I didn't just build a 'hackathon project.' I built a **High-Concurrency Compliance Orchestrator** capable of auditing **1 million transactions in 135 seconds**. My patent background in real-time tracking (**No. 202441077282**) allowed me to create a system that catches 'Machine Speed' attacks that standard rules completely miss."

## 🚀 The Innovation: Soft Computing & Fuzzy Logic

Traditional compliance uses "Hard Rules" (e.g., $5,000 limit) which are easily bypassed by "Structuring". **Sentinel-Node X** uses **Fuzzy Logic (Soft Computing)** to calculate a risk score from 0.0 to 1.0:

*   **0.0 - 0.5 (Low Risk):** Behavioral baseline is stable.
*   **0.5 - 0.9 (Medium Risk):** Triggers multi-agent investigation.
*   **0.9 - 1.0 (Critical):** Instant autonomous account freeze.

## 🌍 Advanced Detection Criteria

We solved the "Human vs. Machine" problem using three distinct mathematical layers:

### 1. Impossible Travel (Geospatial Velocity)
Detects logins that are physically impossible for a human.
*   **Example:** A login in Dubai followed by a login in New York within 1 minute (Requires >5,000 km/h).
*   **Action:** Immediate flag for VPS/Account Takeover.

### 2. Z-Score Anomaly Detection
Uses statistical **Z-Scores** to detect behavioral drift.
*   **Z-Score on Velocity:** Measures the speed of transactions against the user's historical average.
*   **Z-Score on Amount:** If a $10/day trader suddenly attempts $2,000/day, the Z-Score deviates (>2.5).

### 3. Machine-Speed (Structuring) Detection
Most rules miss $0.01 profit trades used for laundering. Sentinel-Node X detects the **Frequency**, flagging any activity exceeding Machine-Speed thresholds (1,000+ per second).
