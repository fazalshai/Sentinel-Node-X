# Sentinel-Node X 🛡️
### High-Concurrency Autonomous Compliance & Risk Orchestrator

**Benchmark:** 🚀 1,147.95 TPS (Transactions Per Second)
**Efficiency:** 📉 97.5% Reduction in Alert Fatigue

## The Problem
Deriv analysts face 2,000+ alerts weekly. 95% are noise. We built a system to find the needles in the haystack in real-time.

## The Tech Stack
- **Ingestion:** C# / .NET 8 (High-speed Stress Bridge)
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph (Multi-Agent State Machine)
- **Intelligence:** Soft Computing (Fuzzy Inference Engine)
- **Grounding:** Gemini 1.5 Pro (UAE AML Regulation Check)

## Core Innovation
Sentinel-Node X uses **Temporal Intelligence** and **Fuzzy Logic** to handle uncertainty. Unlike rigid rules, our system learns behavioral baselines for every user, allowing for autonomous proportional responses (Monitor vs. Freeze).

## Project Structure
- `csharp_client/`: The "Hammer" stress test and high-speed bridge.
- `skills/`: Python-based AI agents (Orchestrator, Compliance Radar, Temporal Analyst).
- `frontend/`: Real-time dashboard (Next.js).
- `main.py`: The FastAPI Gateway.
